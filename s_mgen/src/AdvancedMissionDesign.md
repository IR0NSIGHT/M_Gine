# Mission design
## Political implications
- missions shouldnt just be dumb sidequest, but have political implications
    - every successfull mission increases reputation with the client faction
        - and decreases reputation with enemies of the client faction
        - vice versa for failing missions
        
## Non passive missions
- missions should not be static entities that dont act when ignored, but should come to the player
    - NPCs messaging the player offering/asking/threatening to accept mission for the player
