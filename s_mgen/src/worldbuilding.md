## Missions
- missions reward money and have impact on relations with NPC Factions
    - a successfull missions improves reputation with the client faction
    - a failed mission worsens reputation with the client faction
    
## Reputation
Reputation is the value representing how much an NPC faction likes you.
- bad reputation causes worse econimic deals: higher buy prices, lower sale prices
- sales
    - under a certain reputation, no trading is possible

## mechanics necessary
- money needs to be an important gameplay asset. It can not be unlimited and should not be easy to obtain as a co-product of mining.
- two mechanics to increase the worth of money
    - offer more use for money
    - limit how much money is obtained
both mechanics need to exist. money without stuff to spend on is useless, no money with stuff to buy is useless too.
- Mechanic A: uses of money
    - buying blueprints costs money, price depends on ship/station size 
        - difficult to implement: ships can be spawned thorugh shipyards.
    - using of infrastructure (f.e. public gates) costs money
    - trespassing NPC territory costs money
    - optional services to buy:
        - mercenaries
        - peace treaties with NPCs or pirates
        - influencing NPC politics
- Mechanic B: limit income
    - lower selling prices by a lot, so that selling unwanted mining coproducts is not a viable income strategy
    - force doing missions to obtain money

- core principles
    - spawning ships should be costly but not unobtainable
    - producing income should be doable through multiple, distinctly different way to decrease the feeling of "grind".
    - the amount of time spent on "grinding" should be coupled to the amount of stuff being able to spawn with that income

### Possible income-spending relation
- 50k mass ship requires 5 hours of grinding
- => 10k mass spawnable per hour
- maybe increase income by ~10% to allow more spending on other stuff
